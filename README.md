This is a Trivia game! A question will be displayed for you to answer. You have 4 choices for answers. Guess the right answer and you win! Guess the wrong answer and you lose! 

You have 10 seconds to answer each question. If you pick the wrong answer or timeout, it counts as a loss.

When the user has finished picking their answer, the result of your choice and the solution is shown.

The game will continue for a number of questions until all questions have been answered. A results screen will be displayed, showing the number of questions answered correctly and incorrectly. In addition, a button will appear, allowing you to restart the game if you wish.
